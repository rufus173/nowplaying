# About

This is just a little application i made to try out connecting with dbus. The code absolutely sucks, but it at least works some of the time.
Don't count on it being maintained.

## How to use

Run it. If it doesn't work, then idk what to do. I'm not sure what happens if you have it open when no media is playing. Feel free to report any bugs.

# Install

## Requirements

qt6 (i gave up on the glib implementation)
qmake (technically optional, you can try your luck with the makefile my qmake produced)

## Installation

`./configure` (if you have qmake installed) then `./install` will automatically cleanup after install
